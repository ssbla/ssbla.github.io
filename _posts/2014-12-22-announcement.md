title: Calling all Racers!

Only 5 days left until the 2014 Mario Cup. In order to best accomodate the starting field this year we've pushed the race start back to 3pm on January 1. Everyone here @ the SSBLA is looking forward to daylight racing! Our SSBLA race crew is on the ground digging the track and preparing for the big event. We have plenty of snow and conditions look favorable for a fast and fun race.
