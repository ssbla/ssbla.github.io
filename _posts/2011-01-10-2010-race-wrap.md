####From the director’s desk:

The first annual Mario Cup is wrapped up and ready for the history books! I’d like to congratulate Alex on his victory (albeit narrow) to take home the inaugural Mario Cup trophy. We had a competitive field of 8 and the margin of victory came down to less than 1 second! No such competition can be held without a touch of drama, and this year’s race was no exception.  Complaints were filed regarding race timing and unfair access to the course prior to the race.  The SBLA is currently investigating all claims. Thank you for your participation.  Planning is already under way for 2011, so start training!
