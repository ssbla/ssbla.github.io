excerpt: To the enjoyment of all fans and competitors, the Double B-Cup proved to be another fast, challenging, and fun race in our series. 19 brave racers took to the track @ FastTimes Indoor Karting on the morning of June 16, 2012. A few racers were handicapped by a little too much to drink the night before, but everyone left their best on the track. Racers were permitted 2 or 3 8-minute runs to lay down the fastest lap time of the day.
