title: Plans for 2011
---
We @ Mario Cup HQ had a great conversation with the folks @ SBLA earlier this week to start planning for the 2011 race. One nearly unanimous suggestion was that to ensure a fair race experience for all our competitors we should explore electronic timing systems. To that end, we're going to begin work on a prototype system in the upcoming weeks. Look for more details in March.
