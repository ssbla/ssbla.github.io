<p>Despite poor snow conditions, this year's Mario Cup enjoyed record breaking speeds and participation. The SSBLA would like to thank Race Promoter, Catherine Shortle, for recruiting new racers and creating the largest field of competitors to date. The SSBLA would also like to thank Track Architect, Alex Shortle, for establishing the fastest tracks to date. Due to weather conditions and the late starttime, the curved course was deemed too dangerous for competition. The straight course, however, was fast and thrilling enough. The SSBLA congratulates all racers for completing the course. This year's race did see its first injuries. Scott Harbert allegedly tore his MCL during his spectacular spinning finish, and Bob Shortle injured his knee while practicing. The SSBLA hopes both racers are  recovering quickly and will be in racing shape for next year's event.<p>

<p>This year was a year of many firsts for the Mario Cup. In addition to those mentioned above, the race debuted its first electronic timing system. The SSBLA would like to extend a special thank you to Operational Engineers, Ryan Micallef and Mario Russo, for their unwavering dedication to improving the race experience and accuracy of results. Unfortunately, cold weather halted the use of this new system for the entirety of the race. The engineers are hard at work addressing the issues and have assured us that the system will be operational for future races. The SSBLA hopes to enjoy full use of the new timing system in the spring season and during next year's third running of the Mario Cup.</p>
<p>Last, the SSBLA's Race Committee would like to thank Co-Chairs, Bob and Barb Shortle for once again graciously hosting all race events. The race and many of the racers would not exist if not for them. Thank you.</p>
<p>Again, congratulations to all racers of the 2011 Mario Cup. We hope to see all at next year's race. Each New Year is bigger, better, and faster than the last!</p>
