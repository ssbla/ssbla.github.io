The 2014 Mario Cup has come and gone but will not be soon forgotten. Despite the small turnout, a big hats-off to the entire SSBLA staff for putting on what will go down as the best Mario Cup to-date. A near-perfectly laid out track combined cooperative weather over race week produced a consistent, competitive, and most importantly fun event. The crew gathered some fantastic event footage with the introduction of the overhead track camera. Following the official Mario Cup compeition, the SSBLA team rolled out finish-line speed detection and opened up the course for official Speed Trials, recording finishing speeds in excess of 25 mph. But a big congrats goes out to Meggie Shortle, who set the tone for the entire event by laying down a scorching qualifying time on her first run. She followed suit on her first run of the finals and laid claim to the overall Championship honors as well as the FFF crown with another blazing time that was not beat in regular competition. Outside of normal competition her time was later beaten by Alex Shortle, who took the honors of 2014 Course Record. Look for more info and official times in the next few days.
