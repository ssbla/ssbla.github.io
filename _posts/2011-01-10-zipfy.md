<p>A Zipfy has already arrived @ Mario Cup HQ for some mid-January testing. More track time is scheduled in March, so watch for an update. Initial testing shows it is much more maneuverable than the Wham-O models used in 2010, but at the price of speed.Â  Operation in deep snow is a bit suspect as well. I think this sled may require a wide open, hard track (like the races in the video).</p>
