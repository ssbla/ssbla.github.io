We've been continually refining our event technology since the 2010 Inaugural Mario Cup. What began with a stop watch has developed into an electronic timing system complete with drag-inspired start lights.

Here was our prototype:

The first iteration of the timing system. Single button start/stop.

Slightly more ruggedized packaging for start and finish line. Also introduced a pot to allow menu selection on the LCD. V2 also marked the introduction of the drag-style start lights.

The current implementation using an ammo dry-box to house the electronics. No finish line box anymore - everything is handled at the start box. With this version we've introduced another sensor for tracking speed at the finish line along with track time. We've also added finish-line sensor calibration to accommodate changes in lighting conditions over the course of the race. This is a _huge_ improvement over past versions.

In the past we've had issues with wireless data transmission in the extreme cold (not to mention batteries), so for now we've resorted back to the spool. 500' allows us to make the track as long as we want.

The finish line is the business end of the track. We've played around with a number of different sensors, but in the end a simple photo sensor works great. Not elegant, but we end up destroying a sensor for each race. They are cheap and easy to fabricate, so we keep a couple on hand ready to go.

IF we're racing at dusk / night we illuminate the area.
